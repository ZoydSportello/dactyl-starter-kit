# Secondary Tutorial

This is like [the other tutorial](/tutorials/1/), but it uses frontmatter to define some of its important stuff.

## Prerequisites

Same as the other one.

## Steps

1. Start the document with a `---` line.
2. Add frontmatter in YAML format to the top of the document
3. Separate frontmatter from md content with another `---` line.
